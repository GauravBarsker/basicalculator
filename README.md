***Simple Calculator Project***

**Overview**

This is a simple calculator program built using C++. It performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and modulus.

**Features**

- Performs 6 basic arithmetic operations
- Takes user input for numbers and operation choice
- Handles division by zero errors
- Uses a simple menu-driven interface

**How to Use**

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
2. Run the executable file
3. Follow the menu prompts to select an operation and enter numbers

**Code Structure**

- The code is divided into functions for each arithmetic operation
- A display function shows the menu and takes user input
- A main function controls the program flow and calls the operation functions.

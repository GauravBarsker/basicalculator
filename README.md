ðŸš€ My First Programming Project: Basic Calculator

I recently completed my first programming projectâ€”a basic calculator developed in C++. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what I accomplished:

1. Project Description:

Developed a simple console-based calculator application using C++.
Implemented functionalities for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Included basic error handling for division by zero.
2. Key Learning Points:

Practiced fundamental C++ concepts such as functions, switch statements, and basic input/output operations.
Gained experience in handling different data types (integer and floating-point) within a program.
Improved my problem-solving skills by structuring the program with a user-friendly interface.
3. Challenges Overcome:

Understanding and implementing function prototypes and their respective definitions.
Ensuring the program handles division operations safely to prevent runtime errors.
4. Future Enhancements:

Exploring ways to add more advanced features like exponentiation or modulus operations.
Planning to enhance the user interface with a graphical interface for better usability.
5. Personal Growth:

This project helped me solidify my understanding of core programming concepts and build confidence in tackling more complex programming tasks.
Excited to continue learning and exploring new challenges in the field of software development.
6. Conclusion:

Grateful for the opportunity to apply my classroom learning practically.
Looking forward to sharing more projects and learning experiences as I progress in my programming journey.
